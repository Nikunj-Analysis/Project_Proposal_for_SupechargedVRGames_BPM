# Project_Proposal_for_SupechargedVRGames_BPM

As part of my Business Project Management course at RMIT University, I collaborated with a team to develop a comprehensive project proposal in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) from Supercharged VR Games (SVG). The project was a group assignment, where I worked alongside Abhishek Sharma, Wint Wah Shein, Achutha Kumar, and Bhargava Gajji to design a proposal focused on upgrading SVG’s VR gaming facilities, enhancing soundproofing, and installing new VR equipment and a home theatre system.

Key Contributions and Deliverables:

Developed a detailed project proposal following industry standards, including scope, deliverables, scheduling, budgeting, and risk management.

Conducted a stakeholder analysis and risk assessment to ensure project feasibility and alignment with SVG’s business goals.

Created a work breakdown structure (WBS) and Gantt chart to map out tasks and project milestones.

Researched and selected the most cost-effective VR headsets, soundproofing materials, and audio-visual equipment to meet project requirements.

Proposed a training plan for SVG staff to ensure a smooth transition to the upgraded facility.

Managed budget forecasting, resource allocation, and cost analysis to keep the project within financial constraints.
